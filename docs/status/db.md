# db lane status

Updated with every push. Rows of Day 1: N-005, N-006, N-007, N-008 (`python3 tools/my-rows.py db 1 --full`).

## Done

- **N-005 schema v1a** (`db/migrations/V0001`–`V0006`): schemas `app`, `dw`, `stg`; helpers `app.dhaka_date`,
  `app.div_half_up`, `app.touch_master`, `app.deny_mutation`, monthly partition maintenance
  (`app.partition_policy`, `app.ensure_partitions`); geography (wing, division, territory, house, zone, cluster),
  routes (`visit_kind` daily/3f/2f agreeing with `visit_days_mask`), `route_planned`, users (case-insensitive
  username), `user_scope`, `route_assignment` (one primary per route-day by exclusion), credentials and session
  tables, product tree, SKUs, five price types (`sku_price`, no overlaps), sales plans, offers as data, outlets with
  placement and location history, config registry (172 keys of docs/24 s9.5), scoped values, changes, versions,
  calendar, code lists, targets. Tests: `MigrationApplyTest` (empty DB, second run no-op, edited and removed
  migrations refused), `SchemaV1aTest` (16 rules). Checker: two rounds, all confirmed defects fixed.

## Pushed, checker sign-off pending (fixes, if any, come as new forward-only migrations)

- **N-006 schema v1b** (`V0007`–`V0009`): every contract v1.1 record type has its table with the shared envelope
  (client_uuid, family_uuid, business_date + business_date_device, UTC captured_at, clock evidence, config/bundle
  versions, voided_at); partitioned visit/memo/memo_line/geo_fix/domain_event; immutability guard with write-once
  columns and state-flow triggers; memo arithmetic and line gross as CHECKs; route-day, supervisor-day, QC header,
  due ledger, indent ledger (Phase 2), final submit, submit void, data-void barrier, request trail; programmes,
  gifts, Astha targets, loyalty ledger, content, risk signals; hash-partitioned ingest registry, batch replay,
  rejected, quarantine, server generation, domain-event outbox; V0009 adds the v1.1 code lists and 54 config keys.
  Checker round 1: 3 defects, fixed in 7c3db48; round 2 running.
- **N-007 schema v1c** (`V0010`, `V0011`): devices, bindings (ordinals 0..3), nonces, status reports, rendered
  policy, app package catalogue for the block list, directives, push tokens, releases (maker-checker), enrolment
  tokens (hash only), device FKs, hash-chained append-only audit log with `app.audit_verify()`; dw dimensions,
  partitioned facts, aggregates; `app.dirty_key` with `app.mark_dirty`. Checker running.
- **N-008 seed** (`db/seed/`, `:db:seed`): Daily/3F/2F routes for `sr1001` with 60 outlets, TSO and AMO zone scope,
  42 SKUs x 5 prices from the CSV, test accounts without passwords, dev config overrides; idempotent. Checker running.

## Not verified here

- N-005 "applies on the Azure dev database": not reachable from this container; it needs
  `docs/requests/db-azure-btree-gist.md` (infra) first.

## Requests filed

- `docs/requests/db-azure-btree-gist.md` (infra): allow-list `btree_gist`.
- `docs/requests/db-docs19-config-keys.md` (lead): seed the docs/19 keys outside s9.5?
- `docs/requests/db-config-scope-ids.md` (lead): integer `scope_id` for role and geo_class scopes.
- `docs/requests/db-sku-code-spaces.md` (lead): catalogue SKU codes contain spaces; contract pattern does not.

## Decisions taken (to be copied to DECISIONS.md by the lead; the playbook forbids lanes to edit it)

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-05 | Enumerations are `text` + CHECK with the contract's values, not PostgreSQL enum types | adding a value is an ordinary additive migration |
| 2026-10-05 | `cfg_value.scope_id` is 0 for global, the role ordinal for `role`, the geo_class ordinal for `geo_class` | contract `scope_id` is an integer (request filed) |
| 2026-10-05 | No `cfg_version` 0 row: no row means version 0; version 1 (by the disabled `aron.system` user) carries the s9.5 role defaults: `cfg.auth.password_min_len` 12 and `cfg.auth.access_ttl_min` 15 for DMO, WM, TOP, ANALYST, SUPPORT, ADMIN, SUPERADMIN | s9.5 states those defaults per role; ConfigVersion needs a committing user. TSO counts as a field role (8, 60 min) because it captures on the phone |
| 2026-10-05 | `cfg_key.bounds` holds only ConfigBounds members; free-text bounds (time ranges, rules) go to `cfg_key.bounds_rule`; `risk_class` is the lowest class s9.5 names, `risk_rule` keeps the escalation text | ConfigBounds is `additionalProperties: false` |
| 2026-10-05 | `route` daily requires mask 127, 3f three bits, 2f two bits | contract Route says daily = 127 |
| 2026-10-05 | Master rows: `version` always moves forward on UPDATE (trigger) | If-Match must never match a stale version |
| 2026-10-05 | Tables listed in `app.partition_policy` are never the target of a foreign key; children reference parents by `client_uuid` | re-routing default-partition rows detaches the default partition |

## Notes for other lanes

- Backend: run Flyway with the defaults (`validateOnMigrate` on, `cleanDisabled` true). Call
  `SELECT app.ensure_partitions()` daily from the worker and alert on `app.partition_policy.last_error`.
- Backend: master updates need no version arithmetic; `UPDATE ... WHERE id = :id AND version = :ifMatch` and the
  trigger sets `version + 1` and `updated_at`.
- Tests of the db lane need a role with CREATEDB (each test class creates and drops its own database).
